# murakami-react

A bookshop app where you can browse and 'buy' the works of Haruki Murakami.  

Made with React, React Router v4, and Redux.

Hosted on Heroku, as Github Pages [doesn't support client-side routing](create-react-app-buildpack).
Deployed to Heroku using [create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) and using
[this fix](https://www.darraghoriordan.com/2017/04/30/create-react-app-react-router-and-heroku-the-404-gotcha/).

See the live version [here](https://murakami-react.herokuapp.com/)!

Or to run locally:

git clone  
npm install  
npm start  
```
