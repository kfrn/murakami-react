    {id: 3, title: "A Wild Sheep Chase", year: 1982, cover: "images/Haruki_murakami_a_wild_sheep_chase.jpg", titleJP: "羊をめぐる冒険", titleRomaji: "Hitsuji o meguru bōken", synopsis: "A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery, <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em> is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki Murakami’s international reputation.<br>It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company’s advertisement. What he doesn’t realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em> is Murakami at his astounding best."},

Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into one rip-roaring novel, <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> is the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami's international following. Tracking one man's descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.'"},
    {id: 5, title: "Norwegian Wood", year: 1987, cover: "images/Norwegian_wood.jpg", titleJP: "ノルウェイの森", titleRomaji: "Noruwei no mori", synopsis: "Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before. Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable.

A psychic 13-year-old dropout with a passion for Talking Heads. A hunky matinee idol doomed to play dentists and teachers. A one-armed beach-combing poet, an uptight hotel clerk and one very bemused narrator caught in the web of advanced capitalist mayhem. Combine this offbeat cast of characters with Murakami's idiosyncratic prose and out comes <em>Dance Dance Dance</em>."},

Meanwhile K wonders whether he should confess his own unrequited love for Sumire.<br>Then, a desperate Miu calls from a small Greek island: Sumire has mysteriously vanished."},
    {id: 10, title: "Kafka on the Shore", year: 2002, cover: "images/KafkaontheShore.jpg", titleJP: "海辺のカフカ", titleRomaji: "Umibe no Kafuka", synopsis: "<em>Kafka on the Shore</em> is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.<br>As their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds readers in a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit murder. <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> displays one of the world’s great storytellers at the peak of his powers."},
    {id: 11, title: "After Dark", year: 2004, cover: "images/afterdark.jpg", titleJP: "アフターダーク", titleRomaji: "Afutā dāku", synopsis: "A short, sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakami’s masterworks <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em> and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.<br>At its center are two sisters—Eri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny’s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims they’ve met before, a burly female “love hotel” manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her."},
    {id: 12, title: "1Q84", year: 2009-10, cover: "images/1Q84bookcover.jpg", titleJP: "1Q84", titleRomaji: "Ichi-kyū-hachi-yoni", synopsis: "A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.<br>As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector."},

It is a story of love, friendship, and heartbreak for the ages."},
    {id: 14, title: "The Elephant Vanishes", year: 1993, cover: "images/Haruki_murakami_elephant.jpg", titleJP: "象の消滅", titleRomaji: "Zō no shōmetsu", synopsis: "With the same deadpan mania and genius for dislocation that he brought to his internationally acclaimed novels <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em> and <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em>, Haruki Murakami makes this collection of stories a determined assault on the normal. A man sees his favorite elephant vanish into thin air; a newlywed couple suffers attacks of hunger that drive them to hold up a McDonald's in the middle of the night; and a young woman discovers that she has become irresistible to a little green monster who burrows up through her backyard.<br>By turns haunting and hilarious, <em>The Elephant Vanishes</em> is further proof of Murakami's ability to cross the border between separate realities -- and to come back bearing treasure."},
    {id: 15, title: "after the quake", year: 2000, cover: "images/Afterthequake.jpg", titleJP: "神の子どもたちはみな踊る", titleRomaji: "Kami no kodomo-tachi wa mina odoru", synopsis: "The six stories in Haruki Murakami’s mesmerizing collection are set at the time of the catastrophic 1995 Kobe earthquake, when Japan became brutally aware of the fragility of its daily existence. But the upheavals that afflict Murakami’s characters are even deeper and more mysterious, emanating from a place where the human meets the inhuman."},
    {id: 16, title: "Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman", year: 2006, cover: "images/BlindWillowSleepingWoman.jpg", titleJP: "めくらやなぎと眠る女", titleRomaji: "Mekurayanagi to nemuru onna", synopsis: "Collection of twenty-four stories that generously expresses Murakami’s mastery of the form. From the surreal to the mundane, these stories exhibit his ability to transform the full range of human experience in ways that are instructive, surprising, and relentlessly entertaining. Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami’s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all."}
